## Socrates Project


### App Functions and Overview:
After these interviews, we came out with the idea that can actually help both professor and student.

We will have two interface, one for professor and the other for student.

**Students** can login to the app to rate their confidence level based on their understanding of different materils.

**Professors** can see the rating of each student and decide who to call to answer their questions. Professor will also know better of which topic should be reviewed more or which student should schedule for an extra help.

I really hope this application can help both professor and student to either teach or learn better.
