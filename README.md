## Socrates Project
The purpose of this project was to create a better way for professors and students to have class discussions. We conducted interviews with faculty and students, and then developed our user stories. From these user stories, we selected our priorities and developed a React app that would solve our user's problems.

### App Functions and Overview:
The user stories we decided to focus on were:

As a Professor: I would like to be able know how my students are coping with the material. Professors can pick one of two name generators and receive a selection of three students with varying levels of confidence.

As a Student: As a student, it gives me a lot of anxiety when professors call students out randomly because Iâ€™m afraid of giving the wrong answer.

We designed a multiple-page app with two interfaces; one for the professor and one for the student.

#### Professor Interface
Professors can see how students rated themselves and then decide who to call on in class, to make sure that the students who are called are actually prepared for class. Professors can also use this to gauge overall understanding, and schedule extra review sessions for certain topics.

#### Student Interface
Students can rate themselves based on how prepared they are for the topics to be discussed in class. This alleviates the anxiety they feel from random name generators, because the professor will not call on them if they are unprepared which avoids humiliation.
