## Socrates Project
The purpose of this project was to create a better way for professors and students to have class discussions. We conducted interviews with faculty and students, and then developed our user stories. From these user stories, we selected our priorities and developed a React app that would solve our user's problems.

### App Functions and Overview:
The user stories we decided to focus on were:

As a Professor: I would like to be able know how my students are coping with the material. Professors can pick one of two name generators and receive a selection of three students with varying levels of confidence.

As a Student: As a student, it gives me a lot of anxiety when professors call students out randomly because Iâ€™m afraid of giving the wrong answer.

We designed a multiple-page app with two interfaces; one for the professor and one for the student.
